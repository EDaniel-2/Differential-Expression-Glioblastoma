# Differential-Expression-Glioblastoma  
### The data analysis in this project requires a computer with a very large amount of RAM.

This project analyzes RNA-Seq data of the malignant brain tumor Glioblastoma Multiforme.  
The goal of this project is to understand and clarify the which genes produce Glioblastoma biomarkers as well as more broadly clarify the data science used in gene expression analysis.  

There are 3 parts to this project:  
1.  Preparation
2.  Pipeline
3.  DataAnalysis
